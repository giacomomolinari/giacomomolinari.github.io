		<p>  I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy/">department of Philosophy</a> at
		  the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/"> University of Bristol </a>, under the supervision of 
		  <a href="https://jason-konek.squarespace.com/">Dr. Jason Konek</a>. My research is part of an ERC-funded

		  <i>(Laurea in Informatica)</i> from the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/it">University of Bologna</a>.</p>
		<p> My main interest is in Epistemology, where I investigate how formal theories can be used to address

		  can be employed to justify the foundations of these formal theories. I am particularly interested in
		  the foundations of imprecise probability theory and in its applications in epistemology.

		<h4>An accuracy characterisation of approximate coherence</h4>
		<p> Accuracy-first epistemologists argue that rational agents have probabilistically coherent
		  credences. But why should we care, given that we can't help being incoherent? 
		</p>
		<p>
		  A common answer: probabilistic coherence is an ideal to be approximated as best one can.
		  To spell out this answer we need to show whether, or why, it's generally better to be
		  more rather than less approximately coherent from an accuracy-first perspective.
		  In this essay I give a characterisation of approximate coherence in terms of accuracy. Then
		  I use it to show that accuracy-firsters should maintain that more approximately coherent
		  credences are better than less approximately coherent ones if and only if they accept that
		  it's better to miss out on less rather than more guaranteed accuracy. [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-024-04490-6" target="blank">LINK</a>]

		<h4>Trust the evidence: deference principles for imprecise probability</h4>
		<p> Our intuition that rational agents should value the evidence can be captured by a well-known theorem
		  due to I. J. Good. However, Good’s theorem fails when agents have imprecise credences.
		  This essay shows a different way to capture our starting intuition, as the claim that rational agents
		  defer to their informed selves. I introduce and motivate two deference principles for imprecise probabilities,
		  and show that rational imprecise agents defer to their informed selves according to these principles. This
		  shows a sense in which imprecise agents value the evidence. </p>

		<h4>Towards the inevitability of nonclassical probability</h4>
		<p> I extend Lindley's (1982) argument for probabilism to a number of non-classical logical settings
		  whose truth-values are in the set {0, 1}, and where logical consequence ⊨ is given the “no-drop”
		  characterization. I show that an agent’s credence can only avoid accuracy-domination
		  in these settings if its canonical transform is a non-classical probability function. Therefore, if
		  an agent values accuracy as the fundamental epistemic virtue, rationality requires her credence to
		  have some probabilistic structure. Then I show that, for a certain class of reasonable measures of
		  inaccuracy, having such a probabilistic structure is sufficient to avoid accuracy-domination. [<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-symbolic-logic/article/abs/towards-the-inevitability-of-nonclassical-probability/FBB20E26E4AD4A0C23EE87BED355379B">LINK</a>]

		<h4>Deference principles for imprecise credences</h4>
		<p style="margin-bottom:3cm;">
		  This essay gives an account of epistemic deference for agents with imprecise credences. I look at
		  the two main imprecise deference principles in the literature, known as Identity Reflection and Pointwise
		  Reflection. I show that Pointwise Reflection is strictly weaker than Identity Reflection, and argue
		  that, if you are certain you will update by conditionalisation, you should defer to your future self according
		  to Identity Reflection. Then I give a more general justification for Pointwise and Identity Reflection from the
		  assumption that you defer to someone whenever you consider their doxastic state to be better than yours, in
		  the sense of leading to better decision-making.

		<h4>Following the blind: how to defer to lacking evidence</h4>
		<p style="margin-bottom:3cm;"> Rational agents should follow their evidence. This is easy enough when evidence is nice.
		  But evidence can sometimes be <i>ambiguous</i>, in which case it's not straightforward what
		  it takes for one to follow it.
		  In this essay I argue that evidence can be not only ambiguous, but also <i>scarce</i>. I argue that
		  scarcity and ambiguity are different, orthogonal features of evidence. Then I look at what
		  it means for one to follow the evidence when the evidence is scarce.

		<h4>A global accuracy characterisation of trust</h4>
		<p> Dorst et al. (2021) put forward a deference principle called Total Trust, and characterise it in terms
		  of accuracy: an agent totally trusts an expert iff they expect the expert to be more accurate than them. This
		  note gives a new proof of their result using a global defnition of accuracy due to Konek (Forthcoming),
		  rather than the local one used in the original. This allows for a simpler, direct proof of the global
		  characterisation result. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11166">arXiv</a>]</p>

		<h4>Imprecision and the representation of belief</h4>
		<p> This essay is about the way three characters respond to a formal result connecting categorical
		  (i.e. all-or-nothing) beliefs and precise credences. This result was outlined by Fitelson
		  and Easwaran (2015, 2016) as a response to the preface paradox, but has broader implications.
		  Each character interprets the result from a different philosophical perspective,
		  and uses it for a different purpose. I present a similar result connecting beliefs and imprecise
		  credences, and then evaluate how it affects the views of each character. For at least some of their
		  views, I argue, the imprecise result is a significant improvement. [<a href="./beliefRepDraft.pdf" target="blank">DRAFT</a>]
