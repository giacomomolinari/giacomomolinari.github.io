		<p>  I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/philosophy/">department of Philosophy</a> at
		  the <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/"> University of Bristol </a>, under the supervision of 
		  <a href="https://jason-konek.squarespace.com/">Dr. Jason Konek</a>. My research is part of an ERC-funded
		  <a href="https://jason-konek.squarespace.com/erc-project">project</a> whose aim is to provide an
		  accuracy-centered foundation for imprecise probability. Before starting my PhD, I completed a MA in
		  Philosophy and History of Science at the University of Bristol and a BSc in Computer Science
		  <i>(Laurea in Informatica)</i> from the <a href="https://www.unibo.it/it">University of Bologna</a>.</p>
		<p> My main interest is in Epistemology, where I investigate how formal theories can be used to address
		  philosophical questions about rationality, and at the same time, how philosophical arguments
		  can be employed to justify the foundations of these formal theories. I am particularly interested in
		  the foundations of imprecise probability theory and in its applications in epistemology.

		<h4>Towards the inevitability of nonclassical probability</h4>
		<p> I extend Lindley's (1982) argument for probabilism to a number of non-classical logical settings
		  whose truth-values are in the set {0, 1}, and where logical consequence ⊨ is given the “no-drop”
		  characterization. I show that an agent’s credence can only avoid accuracy-domination
		  in these settings if its canonical transform is a non-classical probability function. Therefore, if
		  an agent values accuracy as the fundamental epistemic virtue, rationality requires her credence to
		  have some probabilistic structure. Then I show that, for a certain class of reasonable measures of
		  inaccuracy, having such a probabilistic structure is sufficient to avoid accuracy-domination. [<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-symbolic-logic/article/abs/towards-the-inevitability-of-nonclassical-probability/FBB20E26E4AD4A0C23EE87BED355379B">LINK</a>]

		<h4>A global accuracy characterisation of trust</h4>
		<p> Dorst et al. (2021) put forward a deference principle called Total Trust, and characterise it in terms
		  of accuracy: an agent totally trusts an expert iff they expect the expert to be more accurate than them. This
		  note gives a new proof of their result using a global defnition of accuracy due to Konek (Forthcoming),
		  rather than the local one used in the original. This allows for a simpler, direct proof of the global
		  characterisation result. [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11166">arXiv</a>]</p>

		<h4>Trust the evidence; deference principles for imprecise probability</h4>
		<p> Our intuition that rational agents should value the evidence can be captured by a well-known theorem
		  due to Good. However, Good’s theorem fails when agents are allowed to have imprecise credences, raising
		  the worry that imprecise probability is inadequate for a theory of rationality. This essay argues that our
		  intuition is best captured as a claim that rational agents defer to their informed selves. I introduce and motivate
		  two deference principles for imprecise probabilities, and show that rational imprecise agents defer to their
		  informed selves according to these principles. I then show that deferring to one’s informed self imposes
		  substantive rationality constraints, in line with our intuitions about the value of evidence, even in cases
		  where Good’s theorem doesn’t apply. [<a href="./deferenceDraft.pdf" target="blank">DRAFT</a>]</p>

		<h4>Coherence: an ideal norm for non-ideal agents </h4>
		<p> We say that your credences are coherent when they respect the laws of probability. Many epistemologists
		  argue that coherence has the status of a rationality norm. A rational agent, they claim,
		  ought to be coherent.</p>
		<p> The coherence norm has been criticised for being excessively idealised. For example, if
		  an agent has a credence towards a logically true statement, the laws of probability require
		  them to have maximal confidence in its truth, no matter how complex the statement.
		  Clearly, this goes well beyond the ability of any human reasoner. And if coherence is
		  a norm we can’t respect, why should we care about it? My aim is to
		  respond to this objection against the coherence norm. I show that, even if you can’t
		  be coherent, you should try to approximate coherence as best you can. To build such a
		  response, I introduce a notion of approximate coherence, defining it in terms of accuracy,
		  and then show that this notion has normative bite, i.e. that non-ideal agents ought to approximate coherence.

		<h4>Imprecision and the representation of belief</h4>
		<p> This essay is about the way three characters respond to a formal result connecting categorical
		  (i.e. all-or-nothing) beliefs and precise credences. This result was outlined by Fitelson
		  and Easwaran (2015, 2016) as a response to the preface paradox, but has broader implications.
		  Each character interprets the result from a different philosophical perspective,
		  and uses it for a different purpose. I present a similar result connecting beliefs and imprecise
		  credences, and then evaluate how it affects the views of each character. For at least some of their
		  views, I argue, the imprecise result is a significant improvement. [<a href="./beliefRepDraft.pdf" target="blank">DRAFT</a>]
